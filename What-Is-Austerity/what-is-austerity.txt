What is Austerity ?

Austerity is a government policy that seeks to eliminate government spending.
It generally focusses on cutting programs that benefit the poorest and most 
vulnerable members of society while ignoring programs that benefit the rich
like prisons and the military industrial complex. Austerity or Budget cuts as
they are called in the US are sold to the public as being necessary because 
we are all "In this together" The rich and the poor. We honorably owe the banks
money so we should suffer. The rich are not targeted by austerity because they
are painted as "job creators". When you look at this argument you can see that
it is self serving and false. Until neo-liberal politics took root under Ronald
Reagan the top tax rate was as high as 90%.

Austerity at its core is an attempt to strangle the working class and make
it more subservient to corporate class and possibly even to kill the poorest
who do not work. The policies of the urban police departments towards poor
urban people of color make it clear that the powers that be regard POC as a 
threat that may need to be eliminated.
