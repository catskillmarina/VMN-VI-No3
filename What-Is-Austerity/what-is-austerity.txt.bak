What is Austerity ?

Austerity is a government policy that seeks to eliminate government spending.
It generally focusses on cutting programs that benefit the poorest and most 
vulnerable members of society while ignoring programs that benefit the rich
like prisons and the military industrial complex. Austerity or Budget cuts as
they are called in the US are sold to the public as being necessary because 
we are all "In this together" The rich and the poor. We honorably owe the banks
money so we should suffer. The rich are not targeted by austerity because they
are painted as "job creators". When you look at this argument you can see that
it is self serving and false. Until neo-liberal politics took root under Ronald
Reagan the top tax rate was as high as 90%.

Austerity at its core is an attempt to strangle the working class and make
it more subservient to corporate class and possibly even to kill the poorest
who do not work. The policies of the urban police departments towards poor
urban people of color make it clear that the powers that be regard POC as a 
threat that may need to be eliminated. Removing benefits from the sick and 
disabled gives the same message. The message is - you are redundant - we want
you to go away and die.

The purpose of government if we are to have one should be to see that the needs
of all people are met. Government should not exist in order to pay the banks
back for money borrowed for war or preparations for war. It should not exist to
protect banks or bail them out at the expense of desparately needy people. 
Working people should not be tricked into supporting the interests of banks or 
the millitary industrial complex. Austerity programs support the interests of 
the rich at the expense of the poor and working classes.

We must resist austerity in the universities where it seeks to take away 
educational benefits. We must resist it when neo-liberal governments try to 
take away food benefits from children and the aged. We must resist when they
try to cut food stamps or cut medical benefits. We must resist when they levy
charges at the drs office or at the food checkout isle. We can resist by 
protesting in the streets, flooding politician offices with angry constituants
and we can camp out in public parks. We can block streets in the financial 
districts to share our pain with those most responsible and most importantly
we can form long lasting organizations to fight for our interests and the 
interests of other oppressed peoples. It's essential that we form bonds of 
solidarity with other groups that share oppressions as the people united will
never be defeated !
