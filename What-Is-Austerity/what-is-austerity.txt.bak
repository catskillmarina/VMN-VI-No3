What is Austerity ?

Austerity is a government policy that seeks to eliminate government spending.
It generally focusses on cutting programs that benefit the poorest and most 
vulnerable members of society while ignoring programs that benefit the rich
like prisons and the millitary industrial complex. Austerity or Budget cuts as
they are called in the US are sold to the public as being neccesary because 
we are all "In this together" The rich and the poor. We honorably owe the banks
money so we should suffer. The rich are not targetted by austerity because they
are painted as "job creators". When you look at this argument you can see that
it is self serving and false. Until neoliberal politics took root under Ronald
Reagan the top tax rate was as high as 90%.
