Why some of us parted ways with Bernie Sanders.

At home Bernie always seems to be saying the right thing, sticking it to the 1% and being
a thorn in the side of the billionaires with thundrous rhetoric that would seemingly make
a revolutionary proud. Revolutionaries oppose war, oppose authoritarian control of peoples
lives for meaningless reasons. They oppose establishment political parties that defend the
status quo.

Wait... Wait... Didn't Bernie send money to Israel when it was bombing Gaza into dust ? Didn't
he support legislation to strenghthen laws against border tunnels. Yes. The same Bernie who
Bused seniors to buy cheap Canadian Drugs supports stronger laws against border tunnels. Last
time i checked border tunnels are mostly used to smuggle prescription drugs like viagra and 
stuff for your and my cholesterol.

...And to get back on topic Bernie is running as a Democrat. The Democrapic party has been 
involved in planning, executing and profiting in every war since WWII. It's truly as much a 
party of war criminals as the Republicans. Bernie has not opposed a Democrat in years. Now he
is running as one. Nuff said.

Here we are socialist, not capitalist warmongers.
